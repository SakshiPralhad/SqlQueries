<p>Welcome to my "Security Investigation System" Google Cybersecurity Certification Portfolio Project. The Security Investigation System is a comprehensive project designed to equip security professionals within large organizations with the tools necessary to effectively investigate potential security issues related to login attempts and employee machines. By leveraging SQL filters to extract and analyze data from the organization's databases, this system aims to enhance security measures and maintain the integrity of the organization's systems.</p>
